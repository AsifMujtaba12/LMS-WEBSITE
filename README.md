# LMS Website â€“ Full Stack MERN Project

A complete Learning Management System (LMS) built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), featuring modern user authentication via Clerk, and Stripe integration for course payments.  
This platform empowers educators to publish courses and earn, while students can enroll, learn, and track their progress online.
